# Password Generator in Python

Welcome to the **Password Generator** â€” a simple Python project that creates strong and random passwords based on your input. Perfect for beginners to understand the use of lists, loops, and the `random` module!

# Features

- Choose how many **letters**, **numbers**, and **symbols** you want
- Combines all characters and shuffles them to ensure randomness
- Easy-to-use input prompts
- Clean and beginner-friendly Python code

# How It Works

1. You input how many letters, numbers, and symbols you want in your password.
2. The program randomly selects those characters from predefined lists.
3. It then shuffles the characters to make the password unpredictable.
4. Finally, it prints the generated password.
